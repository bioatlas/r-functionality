Description: SBDI Bioatlas provides tools to enable users
    of biodiversity information to find, access, combine and visualise data on
    Sweden plants, animals and fungi; these have been made available from
    <https://bioatlas.se/>. SBDI4R provides a subset of the tools based on the 
    ALA4R package, and a few functions custom made for Sweden, which can be 
    directly used within R. It enables the R community to directly access data 
    and resources hosted by the SBDI. Our goal is to enable outputs (e.g. 
    observations of species) to be queried and output in a range of standard formats.
