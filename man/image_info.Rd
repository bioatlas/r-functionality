\title{Fetch information about an image, given its image ID}
\usage{
image_info(id, image_number, verbose = nbn_config()$verbose)
}
\arguments{
\item{id}{character: IDs of images (e.g. as returned by \code{\link{occurrences}}  in the imageUrl column). Each ID will be of a format something like "84654e14-dc35-4486-9e7c-40eb2f8d3faa"}

\item{image_number}{character or numeric: ID numbers of images (e.g. as returned by NBN's image search at \url{https://images.nbnatlas.org/}. Each image_number will be of a format something like 122218480}

\item{verbose}{logical: show additional progress information? [default is set by nbn_config()]}
}
\value{
A data.frame with one row per \code{id}, and at least the columns imageIdentifier and imageURL
}
\description{
Note that there is currently no web service that provides image information, and so we are scraping results from pages of the form https://images.nbnatlas.org/image/details?imageId=id. This web scraping may be fragile, and will be replaced by a web-service-based function when one becomes available.
