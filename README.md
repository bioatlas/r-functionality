# r-functionality
R functionality for SBDI that is not part of the SBDI4R package (for that see  https://github.com/biodiversitydata-se/SBDI4R) or biodiversity-analysis-tools (for that see  https://github.com/biodiversitydata-se/biodiversity-analysis-tools)

Here we compile R code (functions, potential package) to be used with the SBDI.
